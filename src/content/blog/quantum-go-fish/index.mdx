Quantum Go Fish is a game I learned from [Kim Morrison](http://tqft.net) while
I was a grad student at Berkeley. Kim learned it from [Dylan
Thurston](https://dpthurst.pages.iu.edu/). I'm pretty sure it's a descendent of
[quantum fingers](https://everything2.com/title/Quantum+Fingers). My enthusiasm
for the game was directly buttressed by the enthusiasm of [David
Penneys](https://people.math.osu.edu/penneys.2/). I don't remember what version
of the rules I originally learned. The rules described below are the ones I
settled on after trying a bunch of tweaks with my fellow grad students.

The basic nature of the game is that the players start with no information about
any of the cards, and they reduce this uncertainty by asking and answering
questions. "Hoarding uncertainty" is generally a good strategy. Paradoxically,
it's a [complete information
game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_information).

# How to play

Any number of players can play the game. Each player starts with 4
"cards" (traditionally simply the fingers on one of their hands).
Nobody knows the identity of any of the cards to begin with. The players
then take turns playing. When it is your turn, you may ask a player for
a particular suit. If that player has any cards of that suit, she gives
you *one* of them. The players and the game follow the following rules:

1.  There are as many suits as there are players. Traditionally, the
    suits are strange things. You get to invent the name of a suit by
    being the first player to ask for cards of that suit.
2.  There are precisely 4 cards of each suit.
3.  A player may only ask for a suit which she already has a copy of.
    This means that if you provably do not have any ducks, then you may
    not ask another player for ducks. If you *might* have ducks, then
    you may ask for ducks. By asking for ducks, you have determined that
    you do have at least one duck.
4.  If you are asked for a particular suit which you *might* have, you
    may decide whether you do not have that suit (in which case you can
    never ask for that suit thereafter) or whether you do have that suit
    (in which case you must give one card of that suit to the player who
    asked for it).

## How to win

A player can win in one of two ways:

1.  If at the end of your turn (on your turn, you ask a question and get
    an answer), the hands of all players are determined, you win.
2.  If you provably have all four cards of any one suit, and no other
    player has won (based on the previous condition), you win.

## How to lose

If a paradox occurs (e.g. if it turns out there are *five or more* of
some suit in the game), then the players have allowed some illegal move
to occur at some point, so **everybody loses**.

# A sample game

Suppose there are three players, unimaginatively named A, B, and C. Then
there are three suits, which we will for simplicity call 1, 2, and 3.
When the game starts, the three players each have four cards which could
be anything. The state of the game is

> A has ????  
> B has ????  
> C has ????  

A goes first.

> **A:** B, do you have any 1's?

At this point, we know that A must have a 1, so the state of the game is

> A has 1???  
> B has ????  
> C has ????  

Since it is possible that B has a 1, and it is possible that B does not
have a 1, B gets to choose how he answers.

> **B:** Yes, I have a 1. Here you are.  

B gives *one* 1 to A. Now A has at least two 1's. B may still have
another 1. So the state of the game is

> A has 11???  
> B has ???  
> C has ????  

Now it's B's turn.

> **B:** C, do you have any 1's?  

By asking the question, it has been determined that B has a 1, so the
state of the game is

> A has 11???  
> B has 1??  
> C has ????  

Suppose C answers

> **C:** Yes, I have a 1. Here you are.  

Now B has at least *two 1's*, and A has at least two 1's, so all the
1's are accounted for. This means that the remaining cards cannot be
1's. So the state of the game is

> A has 11(not 1)(not 1)(not 1)  
> B has 11(not 1)(not 1)  
> C has (not 1)(not 1)(not 1)  

Now it's C's turn. Note that since C does not have any 1's, she
cannot ask for 1's.

> **C:** A, do you have any 2's?  

The state of the game is now

> A has 11(not 1)(not 1)(not 1)  
> B has 11(not 1)(not 1)  
> C has 2(not 1)(not 1)  

Suppose the answer is

> **A:** No, I don't.  

The state of the game is now

> A has 11(not 1,2)(not 1,2)(not 1,2)  
> B has 11(not 1)(not 1)  
> C has 2(not 1)(not 1)  

But there are only three suits, so as soon as a card is not a 1 or a 2,
it must be a 3. Therefore, the state of the game is

> A has 11333  
> B has 11(not 1)(not 1)  
> C has 2(not 1)(not 1)  

But there are only four 3's total, so at least one of B's cards must
be a 2. Similarly, at least one of C's undetermined cards must be a 2,
so the state of the game is

> A has 11333  
> B has 112(not 1)  
> C has 22(not 1)  

We see that A's answer has really reduced the amount of uncertainty in
the game! Now it's A's turn. Note that A has no 2's, so he cannot ask
for 2's.

> **A:** C, do you have any 3's?  

Since we already knew that A had 3's, this question does not change the
state of the game.

> **C:** No, I don't.  

This means that C's (not 1) is not a 3, so it must be a 2, which means
that B's (not 1) must be a 3. So at the end of A's turn, the state of
the game is

> A has 11333  
> B has 1123  
> C has 222  

Since all the hands are determined, **A wins**.

# A physical deck for the game

Quantum Go Fish is traditionally played by trying to keep track of the
state of the game entirely mentally, often while inebriated. Though
that's fun, I came up with a physical deck for playing the game which
automatically does a lot of the bookkeeping for you, freeing your brain
cycles up to strategize.

The basic observation is that each player has some cards which are
determined, and some which are not, and the cards which are undetermined
are *undetermined in exactly the same way*. In other words, a hand might
look like 1(2 or 3)(2 or 3)3, but it cannot look like 1(2 or 3)(1 or
3)3.

With this in mind, the physical deck for 6 players (you can replace 6 by
$n$ if you wish) consists of 6 packets, each packet consists of

-   6 cards numbered 1 through 6, and
-   4 paperclips

When the game starts, each player places the 6 cards face up in front of
him, and has 4 paperclips in hand. **The paperclips represent the
player's hand, and the cards represent the possible suits of the
paperclips.** Read the previous sentence again. **When the suit of a
paperclip becomes determined, you attach it to the card corresponding to
its suit. When a player cannot have any paperclips of a given suit, he
turns the card corresponding to that suit face down.**

Suppose I ask a player for a 5. If there is a paperclip attached to my 5
card, it means we already knew that I had a 5, so nothing changes. If I
do not have a paperclip attached to my 5 card, I attach one of the
paperclips I have in hand to the 5 card.

Suppose another player asks me for a 5. If I have a paperclip attached
to my 5 card, then I remove that paperclip from the card, give it to the
other player, and she attaches it to her 5 card. If I do not have a
paperclip attached to my 5 card (but I have at least one paperclip in
hand), then I either

-   say "yes, I have a 5," give one of my paperclips to the other
    player, and she attaches it to her 5 card, or
-   say "no" and turn my 5 card face down.

Note that not all events (attaching a paperclip or turning a card face
down) are triggered by a question or an answer. For example, in the
sample game above, all the interesting deductions we were able to make
after A said he didn't have any 2's would have to be worked out
logically. If a player works something out, she announces it to the
other players, paperclips are attached, cards are turned over, and the
game continues.

## The sample game, revisited

Let's walk through how the sample game would look with the physical deck. Each
player starts with 4 paperclips not attached to anything:

<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />

When A asks "B, do you have any 1's?", we know that one of A's paperclips must
be a 1, so it's attached to the 1 card:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 1, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />

When B answers "yes", and gives a 1 to A, that paperclip must be a 1:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />

When B asks "C, do you have any 1's?", we know that one of B's paperclips is a 1:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 1, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={4} />

When C answers "yes", we have:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />

Except now all the 1's are accounted for, so C's paperclips cannot be 1's. C
indicates this by turning over the 1 card:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />

After C asks "A, do you have any 2's?"
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />

And after A answers "no":
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={3} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />

Since all the 1's are accounted for, A's remaining paperclips _must_ be 3's:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 3 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 0, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={2} />

Since there are only four 3's total and A has three of them, at least one of B's
paperclips must be a 2. Similarly, at least one of C's paperclips must be a 2:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 3 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={1} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 2, '3': 0 }} paperclips={1} />

Finally, after A asks "C, do you have any 3's?" and C answers "no":
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 3 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={1} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 2, '3': -1 }} paperclips={1} />

C's remaining paperclip must be a 2, since it can't be anything else:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 3 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 1, '3': 0 }} paperclips={1} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 3, '3': -1 }} paperclips={0} />

And that means B's remaining paperclip can't be a 2, so it must be a 3:
<QGFHand name="A" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': -1, '3': 3 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="B" cards={{ '1': 2, '2': 1, '3': 1 }} paperclips={0} />
<QGFHand name="C" cards={{ '1': -1, '2': 3, '3': -1 }} paperclips={0} />

Since all the hands are determined and it's the end of A's turn, A wins.
